# Software Design Principles

This document outlines the core software design principles to be followed in this project. These principles are language-agnostic and apply to all parts of the codebase.

## 1. SOLID Principles

SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

### S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **Rule:** A class or module should have one, and only one, reason to change. This means it should have only one job or responsibility.
- **Application:** In the backend, a `Service` class should not handle database access directly; that is the responsibility of a `Repository`. In the frontend, a React component should not fetch data, manage complex state, and render a UI all at once. These concerns should be separated into custom hooks, services, and smaller UI components.

### O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **Rule:** Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
- **Application:** Instead of changing existing code to add new functionality, use interfaces, abstract classes, or composition to allow new features to be added with minimal changes to the existing, tested codebase. For example, if adding a new document type for ingestion, it should not require changing the core `IngestionService`. Instead, a new implementation of a `DocumentParser` interface could be created.

### L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **Rule:** Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.
- **Application:** When creating a subclass or implementing an interface, ensure that the new class honors the contract of the base class or interface. It should not throw new exceptions or have more restrictive preconditions.

### I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **Rule:** No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. Make interfaces fine-grained and client-specific.
- **Application:** Instead of creating large, monolithic interfaces, create smaller, more focused ones. For example, instead of a single `AdminService` interface with 20 methods, create smaller interfaces like `UserManagementService`, `FaqManagementService`, and `DocumentManagementService`.

### D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- **Rule:** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces). Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
- **Application:** In the backend, `Service` classes should depend on `Repository` interfaces, not on concrete `RepositoryImpl` classes. This allows the underlying data store to be changed without affecting the business logic. This is achieved through Dependency Injection (DI).

## 2. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- **Rule:** Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.
- **Application:** Avoid duplicating code. If you find yourself writing the same code in multiple places, extract it into a reusable function, method, or component. This makes the code easier to maintain, as changes only need to be made in one place.

## 3. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

- **Rule:** Most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore, simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.
- **Application:** Always seek the simplest solution that solves the problem. Avoid over-engineering and adding features that are not currently required.

## 4. YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)

- **Rule:** Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them.
- **Application:** Do not add functionality on the assumption that it will be needed in the future. This avoids cluttering the codebase with unnecessary code that may never be used and adds to the maintenance burden.

## 5. Composition Over Inheritance

- **Rule:** Favor has-a relationships (composition) over is-a relationships (inheritance).
- **Application:** While inheritance has its uses, composition often leads to more flexible and maintainable designs. It allows for behavior to be changed at runtime and avoids the tight coupling and fragile base class problems associated with deep inheritance hierarchies.

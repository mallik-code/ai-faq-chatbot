# Architectural Guidelines

This document defines the high-level architectural patterns and standards for the project to ensure a scalable, resilient, and maintainable system.

## 1. Core Architectural Style

- **Style:** The project follows a **Layered (N-Tier) Architecture** within a **Client-Server Model**.
- **Frontend (Client):** A Single-Page Application (SPA) responsible for presentation and user interaction.
- **Backend (Server):** A stateless service that exposes a RESTful API and contains all business logic.

## 2. Backend Architecture

### Layered Architecture
- **Controller Layer:** The entry point for all API requests. Its sole responsibility is to receive and validate input, delegate to the service layer, and return an appropriate HTTP response. It should not contain any business logic.
- **Service Layer:** Contains the core business logic of the application. It orchestrates calls to repositories and other services. Transactions are typically managed at this layer.
- **Repository Layer:** Responsible for all data access. It abstracts the data source (e.g., PostgreSQL database) and provides a clean API for the service layer to interact with data. It should not contain business logic.

### API Design
- **RESTful APIs:** All APIs must be RESTful, stateless, and follow the guidelines in `shared.md`.
- **API Gateway:** While not implemented for this project's initial scope, for future expansion with multiple microservices, an API Gateway would be introduced to act as a single entry point for all clients.

## 3. Frontend Architecture

- **Component-Based Architecture:** The UI is built as a collection of small, reusable, and independent components.
- **Container/Presentational Pattern:**
    - **Container Components:** Concerned with *how things work*. They manage state, fetch data, and render corresponding presentational components.
    - **Presentational Components:** Concerned with *how things look*. They receive data and callbacks via props and are not aware of the application's state.

## 4. Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Caching
- **Strategy:** A caching strategy will be implemented to improve performance and reduce load on the backend and external services.
- **Backend:** Use Spring's caching abstractions. A distributed cache like Redis (via GCP Memorystore) can be used for caching frequently accessed data, such as FAQ entries or document chunks.
- **Frontend:** Use a library like React Query to cache API responses on the client, reducing redundant network requests.

### Resiliency and Fault Tolerance
- **Retries:** For transient failures when communicating with external services (e.g., Vertex AI), implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff.
- **Circuit Breaker:** To prevent a single failing service from cascading failures throughout the system, a circuit breaker pattern (e.g., using Resilience4j) should be considered. If an external service is down, the circuit breaker will trip and fail fast, preventing the application from waiting for timeouts.
- **Timeouts:** All network calls must have a configured timeout.

### Database
- **Connection Pooling:** The backend application must use a database connection pool to efficiently manage connections to the PostgreSQL database.
- **Migrations:** All schema changes must be managed through a migration tool like Flyway. This ensures that schema changes are version-controlled and can be applied consistently across all environments.

## 5. Future Architectural Evolution

- **Microservices:** While the current architecture is a monolith, it is designed with future evolution in mind. The clear separation of concerns in the layered architecture would facilitate the extraction of services into independent microservices if the need arises. For example, the `rag-service` could be a candidate for extraction.
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** For asynchronous and decoupled communication between services (especially in a microservices environment), an event-driven architecture using a message broker like Pub/Sub could be adopted.
